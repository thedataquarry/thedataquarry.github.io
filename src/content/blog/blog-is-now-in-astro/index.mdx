Welcome back to the blog, and hope you like its new skin! I spent most of my spare time over the last
week migrating my blog from [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/). If you recall, the
earlier version of this blog was built with Zola, a static site generator (SSG) written in Rust. I've been very happy
with Zola over the last year, and even today there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

The purpose of this post is to explain my thoughts on why I wanted to rewrite this site in [Astro](https://astro.build/),
a JavaScript-based web framework for content-driven websites. Yes, JavaScript. I used to be very anti-JS in most of my personal projects
because I'd heard it slowed down websites, and I had a very limited knowledge of the frontend ecosystem in general.
As an AI and machine learning person by training, my world has mostly been in Python (and recently, some Rust).

So why Astro, specifically? For the last one year, I've been working at [Kùzu Inc.](https://kuzudb.com) as an AI engineer, and
I've successfully migrated both the [documentation](https://docs.kuzudb.com/) and the
[blog](https://blog.kuzudb.com/) sites of Kuzu to Astro. I'd only heard good things about Astro from
fellow developers, and my experience in rewriting Kuzu's docs and blog in Astro was a great experience.
So I began thinking of making the switch for this site as well.

Migrations are always a fair amount of work, and there are always starting pains when learning
something new, though they were greatly alleviated by working with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Cursor to
translate my past blogs to Astro's MDX format. I'll highlight some of these aspects in the rest of this post.

## Why Astro?

Like it or not, JavaScript (and more recently, TypeScript) are designed from the ground up for the web.
Naturally, the ecosystem around them is _huge_. For almost any requirement,
there's likely a JS/TS framework and package out there that can help you. After nearly a year of using Zola
(and leveraging the far smaller Rust web dev ecosystem), I was finding that I was needing a lot of manual
effort to add some aesthetics and make my site look better.

After some scanning the web for some sites that were built using Astro, some of them are objectively
_beautiful_[^1]. Not that sites built in Zola are ugly -- given enough time and effort, I could have
definitely redesigned the Zola version of the blog to look more aesthetically pleasing.

Where Astro came in is due to the following features:

- Ability to leverage the vast frontend ecosystem and community already building great sites using JS, TS, JSX and Tailwind CSS.
- Huge number of existing & aesthetically pleasing [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) for blog sites
- Component-driven, allowing me to add/remove UI components easily and intuitively
- Easy to leverage LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet[^2] and modern IDEs that can help modify the codebase without
the typical frustrations of switching to something totally unfamiliar

## Performance considerations

My initial (uninformed) concern was that my Astro site would be slower than Zola because of the overhead of JavaScript.
However, my ongoing experience managing Kuzu's sites at my day job told me otherwise -- I found
that most Astro sites I visited were fast and snappy to load. So I did some more reading to learn more about the
internals of Astro.

Astro is well-known for introducing the [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/),
which is a way to optimize the performance of the website by rendering a majority of the page via fast,
static HTML, and only using "islands" of JavaScript when interactivity or personalization is needed.
This is _perfect_ for the purposes of a blog site, where most of the content is static, and you may
only occasionally need to add dynamic embeds like YouTube videos or Twitter threads.

## Moving on from Zola

When I first discovered Rust in 2023, I was sold on the idea of using it wherever I could, leading to me
building the previous version of this site with [Zola](/blog/why-zola-matters). With my rudimentary knowledge of
Rust and Zola's templating language, Tera, I was able to customize the [Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene)
to my liking.

However, after my experience with Astro as part of my job duties at Kuzu, I'm glad I made the switch. The ability
to use Tailwind CSS and JSX to build the site, made it easier for me to get a better looking site and
add custom components. My experience with Zola was undoubtedly positive, and I'd largely attribute my
inability to customize my Zola theme to skill issues on my part, and not Zola's fault. That being said,
I was still looking for a tool that had a larger user community I could leverage to get a better looking site
without having to burn the midnight oil.

## Choosing a theme

The first step in building a static blog site is choosing an appropriate theme. An ideal theme
contains 90% or more of the features I'd need out of the box, allowing me to customize the remaining 10%
to make the site look the way I want. I found the _perfect_ theme for my needs in
[Astro Pure](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure). It had all the pre-built UI components and formatting
features I needed, so I didn't have to spend time building them on my own in Astro.

I started by creating a new repo using the Pure theme repo as a template, and began customizing it from there.
My blog writing style typically involves me explaining my thought process on a topic, with specific examples in which
I use a variety of means to illustrate my points.

These are all the components I needed out of the box, provided by the Pure theme:
- Callouts (also known as asides)
- Timelines
- Code blocks with custom line highlighting
- Footnotes
- KaTeX for math equations
- Non-intrusive sidebar with table of contents
- Inbuilt search box to easily locate past posts
- And more!

With all these raw components in place, I was immediately able to translate my past blogs written in Zola's
templating syntax embedded in Markdown to Astro's MDX format.

## The marvel of developing with LLMs in Cursor

While customizing the theme, my lack of knowledge of TypeScript would normally have been a huge
roadblock. For example, I wanted to disable the comments system (who needs comments on a blog site? Reach
out to me via [X](https://x.com/tech_optimist) instead!). I also wanted to add a LinkedIn profile in the home page.

This involved modifying tons of custom TypeScript files, and I'm super glad I had [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
and its faithful sidekick, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to help me out.

To demonstrate how useful they were, I came across a strange issue where the theme's datetime calculation
was off by a day. When I entered the post's published date in the post's frontmatter as `2023-04-29`, the
theme was rendering it as `April 28, 2023`, which was a day off. I was initially scratching my head as to the source of the problem,
but it took me all of two minutes to get two potential solutions from Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Cursor.

Not knowing a thing about how timezones and datetimes worked in TypeScript, this is the initial question
I asked in Cursor chat to put Claude 3.5 Sonnet to work:

<Image src={Img1} alt="Explaining to Claude 3.5 Sonnet about the datetime issue in the Astro theme" />

The model's response was nuanced, giving me two different ways to fix the issue. I ended up going with the second
approach that sets the default timezone to UTC, because I'd like to preserve the exact date of the blog post's publication.

<Image src={Img2} alt="Claude 3.5 Sonnet suggesting a solution in Cursor's chat interface" />

All in all, I continued addressing my own feature requests, needs and wants this way, and it took me all of 2-3
days of work (among other things) to get the site up and running. Not bad at all!

## Timeline components and more

In Astro, blogs are typically written in MDX files, which is a markdown-like syntax that allows you to
incorporate JSX code for custom UI components. This is _extremely_ useful for static blog sites when
you want to illustrate your points with timelines, callouts, code blocks and more.

Say I want to describe a timeline of events, such as the history of this blog, I can use the `Timeline`
component that's built into the Pure theme. In Astro, it would be a simple import statement followed by
the component definition, as shown below. Note that this would have been a lot harder for me in Zola,
where I'd have had to write my own custom component and mess around with styles to get it to look this good.

```tsx
import { Timeline } from 'astro-pure/user';

<Timeline
  events={[
    {
      date: "2020-04-01",
      content: "Started my journey in building a static blog site using Jekyll"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-04-29",
      content: "Initial \"Hello World\" blog post on thedataquarry.com, powered by Hugo"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-11-30", 
      content: "Revamped this blog site to be powered by Zola, using the Serene theme"
    },
    {
      date: "2025-02-25",
      content: "Another site revamp, this time using Astro and the Pure theme"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

This now embeds the timeline component in the page, and it looks like this:

<Timeline
  events={[
    {
      date: "2020-04-01",
      content: "Started my journey in building a static blog site using Jekyll"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-04-29",
      content: "Initial \"Hello World\" blog post on this site, powered by Hugo"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-11-30", 
      content: "Updated blog site powered by Zola, using the Serene theme"
    },
    {
      date: "2025-02-25",
      content: "Revamp of this site to use Astro Pure theme"
    }
  ]}
/>

Adding callouts or aside box components to emphasize a point was also a breeze. The syntax was a lot more
straightforward in Astro than it was in Zola (where I had to use Tera, a jinja-like templating language).

In Astro, it's expressed using this simple JSX block (much more intuitive and easier on the eyes than
the `{% aside() %} ... {% end %}` block in Zola).

```tsx
<Aside type="caution" title="Here's an example">
  I want to warn you about something.
</Aside>
```

Here's how this would look per this theme:

<Aside type="caution" title="Here's an example">
  I want to warn you about something.
</Aside>

Overall, I found the aesthetics of the Pure theme to already be very pleasing to the eye to begin with, so I didn't
spend any time customizing the CSS. However, there were plenty of structural changes I did end up making, and
the transition to Astro was really smooth.

Thanks to the widespread usage of Astro in so many amazing sites out there, it has a large user community
and there are custom components for all sorts of things. I'm sure I'll be able to add even more custom components in the
future as needed, without too much effort.

## Conclusions

It's been a 4+ year journey since I first started writing static blogs in Markdown, and I've migrated from Jekyll (where I started)
to Hugo, to Zola and now Astro. For me, static sites and self-hosting are always the way to go, because I love the flexibility
they offer in customizing the look and feel of my site. I've also always loved supporting and talking about open source projects,
and Astro is truly among the best out there. It's very widely adopted,
has a large and enthusiastic user base, and it's really easy to get started with building your own static site using an
existing theme as a baseline. Once you begin, the world's your oyster!

Through my writing in this blog, I've been exposed to so many amazing people from all over the world, so I naturally
want to give the site the best look possible while also making it easier to maintain the site for the longer term. My writing style
involves multiple ways to illustrate my points, so a "minimalist" theme that doesn't use any JavaScript would make
this more challenging. This is what led me to explore the JavaScript ecosystem,
and ultimately, the Astro framework to upskill myself.

I'm no longer worried about the performance impact of including JavaScript in my site, because of the islands architecture
that's integral to Astro. The static site that's served is not monolithic, so any JavaScript payloads are
loaded separately from the static HTML. Sites built in Astro are _fast_, and there are plenty of comparisons between
Astro and other JavaScript web frameworks you can find online that validate this claim[^3].

I'll still continue supporting the Rust 🦀 ecosystem in other ways by using so many other tools built in Rust, and I
wish the maintainers of Zola well -- in my opinion, it's still one of the best SSGs written in Rust out there.
But for the foreseeable future, I'm very happy using Astro for this site, and I hope you can also give it a try
for your next static site!

[^1]: See Sentry.io's Python SDK [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/) for an example of a beautiful site built with Astro.
[^2]: Anecdotally speaking, I've found that LLMs tend to write better TypeScript code than they do Rust code. In this blog's case,
Zola, which uses the Tera templating language, is even more niche because it uses Jinja-like templating alongside
Rust code. In contrast, Astro uses TypeScript, JSX, and Tailwind CSS, which are all new to me, but LLMs seem to do well with them.
[^3]: This excellent comparison by [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/astro-vs-next-js/) shows that Astro sites are generally faster than Next.js sites,
although with some nuances. Next.js is a more feature-rich framework than Astro, and Astro is easier to get started with than Next.js, is fast, and a perfect fit
for simple blog sites like this one.
