This is the second post in a series on learning [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/), a modular framework for
programming, not prompting LMs. [Part 1](/blog/learning-dspy-1-the-power-of-good-abstractions),
introduced the three core abstractions of DSPy: signatures, modules and optimizers, deep-diving
into the first two. Having great abstractions like these allows developers to more
easily build reliable, self-improving compound AI systems. In
this post, we'll go a bit deeper into the internals of a DSPy program, including the role of
adapters and how signatures and modules neatly tie things together, enabling optimization
down the line. We'll also inspect the prompt that DSPy generates under the hood, showcasing
how transparent the whole process is, end-to-end.

## Looking inside a DSPy pipeline

Let's put on our developer hats and think through the code we write for a typical DSPy pipeline.
The goal in the simple example below is to extract a structured output (a resume) from the given
text using a language model (LM). The code is available [here](https://gist.github.com/prrao87/d96b4a0880507d5581c095ac0c2e3cff).

<Figure src={Img2} />

The following components are used in this pipeline:

1. **LM**: DSPy supports all the well-known language model providers, so we start by declaring which
one we want to use (including some optional parameters, like temperature, etc., if needed).
2. **Data model**: Pydantic is a first-class citizen in any DSPy pipeline, and it's used to precisely
describe the structure of the desired data to the LM. In this case, a Pydantic model is defined
that indicates the data types of each field we want in the `Resume` model[^1].
3. **Signature**: A new signature is created, where you start by writing a docstring that explains
your intent, with the input and output fields clearly marked for the LM.
Note that whatever's in the docstring (in this case, "_Extract the resume from the text_"),
is _not_ the same as a conventional prompt -- it's simply a user instruction or a declaration of intent.
The full prompt sent to the LM is constructed by an _adapter_,
whose role is described below. The signature allows the user to combine a structured definition (in code)
with an instruction in natural language, such that DSPy can then decide what the prompt should look like for the LM.
4. **Module**: In this case, the simplest module, `Predict`, is used. The module takes in the signature
(which constructed the prompt using the data model and user instructions), and invokes the LM to
make a prediction based on the prompt that DSPy formulates for it.

The output of a module in DSPy is a `Prediction` object (which is different from a `Predict` module).
The `Prediction` object contains the requested output fields from DSPy, in this case, `resume`, which
conforms to the Pydantic model we requested in the signature.
```bash
Prediction(
    resume=Resume(first_name='Samuel', last_name='Colvin', languages=['Python', 'Rust'], frameworks=['Pydantic'])
)
```

Contrary to popular belief, the primary goal of DSPy is _not_ prompt optimization. As can be seen above, DSPy is simply a way
to build modular AI systems using composable building blocks. Optimization is _optional_ in DSPy, and is not
the primary focus when you're just starting. You begin any DSPy pipeline by writing
the signatures and modules, and run the pipeline end-to-end. You also provide examples
(via a small annotated dataset) that allow you to evaluate the baseline before attempting
to use an optimizer to improve the program.

To go from the raw inputs to the final output, there's quite a lot happening under the
hood, so it's worth digging a little deeper into the internals. The following figure
highlights the "six pieces" of DSPy:

<Figure src={Img3} alt='The "six pieces" of DSPy: LMs, signatures, modules, examples, optimizers and adapters' />

There are a few new additions to the high-level diagram shown in the
[previous post](/blog/learning-dspy-1-the-power-of-good-abstractions): LMs, adapters and examples.
Signatures specify _what_ the LM should do, and _what_ data flows into the module. The adapter controls
_how_ the data and types in the prompt are formatted based on the given signature and module.
Below, we'll inspect the prompt that's generated by the adapter in more detail.

An `Example` is the core type for holding data in DSPy. Just like in conventional machine learning, examples
in DSPy allow you to represent data samples for testing (i.e., _evaluating_) the performance
of the AI pipeline, and to serve as training data to improve the pipeline via optimization. The `Prediction`
object that's returned by a module is a special subclass of `Example`. This means that a module in
DSPy is designed, from the ground up, to work seamlessly with optimizers that use `Example` instances
to inform the optimization algorithm how to improve the program based on the given `Prediction`.
The module is responsible for invoking calls to the LM, and any data the module receives is handled
by the signature (and its underlying adapter).

With these design concepts in mind, we can answer the following questions about DSPy:

### How is it declarative?

Signatures, modules and optimizers are _all_ declarative ways to express the user's intent to the LM.
You can write any logic for your domain with LMs using clean, readable and concise code.

**Signatures**

In conventional prompting frameworks, it's the norm for users to write the entire prompt by
hand, observe the output, and iteratively refine the wording of the prompt till the desired output
is achieved. This process can be tedious and requires a deep understanding of the model's behaviour.
In DSPy, you focus on defining _signatures_, not prompts. The signature serves as a high-level
description of the task _for DSPy_, not the LM. It's DSPy's responsibility to then describe the
task to the LM to achieve the intended output.

**Modules**

The conventional idea of prompting involves the user formulating the strategy for how
to interact with the LM, by writing in the instructions by hand. For example, today, chain-of-thought
prompting or few-shot prompting are common strategies to elicit more complex responses from the LM
in a way that adheres to the system message in the prompt. In DSPy, you simply declare the high-level
prompting strategy by either using a built-in module (like `Predict`, `ReAct` or `ChainOfThought`) or by
defining your own custom module.

**Optimizers**

The conventional idea of prompt optimization is one where the user is expected
to handle the low-level details of extracting parts of the prompt or defining few-shot examples so
that the LM better understands the task. In DSPy, optimization is a higher level construct,
where the module seamlessly integrates with the optimizer
to automatically handle these details (via `Example` and `Prediction` instances), allowing the
user to focus on higher-level task definitions, such as defining their intent via the signature,
and defining examples for evaluation.
To optimize a DSPy program, you simply declare what optimizer you want,
give it the examples and the required hyperparameters, and call the module's `compile` method.
That's it!

### How is it self-improving?

In DSPy, a user writes an "LM program", which looks something like the example shown above. All the
optimizer needs to improve a given program is examples, i.e., demonstrations of how a "good" result
should look. That's it.

It's important to note that optimizers in DSPy are designed to **_not_** rely on gradients.
Because a module can be composed of multiple other modules, each with their own specific
tasks and behaviours, DSPy makes no assumptions whatsoever about the continuity of the input space.
DSPy optimizers can operate in a highly discontinuous input space for
any custom module without relying on gradient information or access to an LM's weights. This aspect of
optimization in DSPy is what enables _self-improvement_, because all the optimizer needs
to improve the program is examples.

Using a combination of optimizers, an LM program can gradually be improved over time as more and
more examples are obtained from the real world, serving as training data for ever-improving optimization
algorithms coming out every few months. DSPy's optimizers can thus operate in a continuous feedback loop, where the
performance of the LM program can be iteratively improved based on monitoring real-world outcomes,
all while making the metrics that are being optimized for, clearly visible and transparent.

## Show me the prompt

At this point, it's worth revisiting an excellent [blog post](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/prompt/)
from 2024 by Hamel Husain[^2] that stresses on the importance of developers deeply understanding
and inspecting what goes into a prompt. In this section, we'll explore what DSPy does under the hood,
showing that it isn't dark magic or a blackbox in any way, shape or form.

<Figure src={Img1} alt="Fuck you, show me the prompt" />

The first step is to define an LM.

```py
import dspy
# Put in your LM of choice here
lm = dspy.LM('gemini/gemini-2.5-flash', api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

To inspect the prompt being generated by DSPy, you can use the `dspy.inspect()` method downstream
of the module being run.

```py
# Define your data model and signature

# Create a Predict module that uses the `ExtractResume` signature
extractor = dspy.Predict(ExtractResume)

text = """
    Samuel Colvin is the creator of Pydantic. His main languages
    are Python and Rust.
"""

# Run the module
resume = extractor(text=text)
# Print the most recent LM invocation's prompt
print(dspy.inspect_history(n=1))
```

The prompt that's formulated by the adapter is as follows:

```
System message:

Your input fields are:
1. `text` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `resume` (Resume):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## text ## ]]
{text}

[[ ## resume ## ]]
{resume}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {"type": "object", "properties": {"first_name": {"type": "string", "title": "First Name"}, "frameworks": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Frameworks"}, "languages": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Languages"}, "last_name": {"type": "string", "title": "Last Name"}}, "required": ["first_name", "last_name", "languages", "frameworks"], "title": "Resume"}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Extract the resume from the text.

User message:

[[ ## text ## ]]

      Samuel Colvin is the creator of Pydantic. His main languages
      are Python and Rust.
    

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## resume ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Resume), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
```

The system message begins with an
explicit instruction stating what the signature's input and output fields are. This is followed by
a template that describes how the interaction will be structured, with placeholders for each input
and output field. Towards the end of the system message, the instructions provided in the signature's
docstring are placed as-is (with no modifications).

In the user message, the actual input data is placed, and the prompt ends with the instructions
for the output types being reiterated. This is the full prompt that's being formulated under the hood,
and its contents are transparent to the user.

<Aside>
For Pydantic models that are referenced in the signature (in this example, `Resume`), we can see that
the default adapter in DSPy, [`ChatAdapter`](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/adapters/#chatadapter),
formats the the Pydantic model as JSON schema. This is quite
verbose, and for nested Pydantic models, the verbosity of the JSON schema can confuse the LM and negatively
impact the quality of structured outputs.

Like most other things in DSPy, adapters are customizable. In a future post,
we'll get into how one can write and evaluate custom adapters on structured output tasks, but for now,
suffice to say this: in case the built-in adapters in DSPy don't meet your needs, you can always create your own.
</Aside>

What if we use a different module than `Predict`? Because DSPy is declarative, the user doesn't need to change
the signature -- by changing the module, the underlying prompting strategy changes automatically. The
example below shows the prompt if a
`ChainOfThought` module were used instead of `Predict`. Note the highlighted lines below: it's very
similar to the `Predict` module's prompt, except that there are
additional instructions placed in the output field description that tells the LM to include a reasoning
of its answer.

```
System message:

Your input fields are:
1. `text` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):    // [!code highlight]
2. `resume` (Resume):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## text ## ]]
{text}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]]  // [!code highlight]
{reasoning}  // [!code highlight] 

[[ ## resume ## ]]
{resume}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {"type": "object", "properties": {"first_name": {"type": "string", "title": "First Name"}, "frameworks": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Frameworks"}, "languages": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Languages"}, "last_name": {"type": "string", "title": "Last Name"}}, "required": ["first_name", "last_name", "languages", "frameworks"], "title": "Resume"}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Extract the resume from the text.

User message:

[[ ## text ## ]]

      Samuel Colvin is the creator of Pydantic. His main languages
      are Python and Rust.
    

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## resume ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Resume), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.    // [!code highlight]
```

The above examples show that in DSPy, the user doesn't actually write the prompt that's sent to the LM.
The user simply defines a _signature_, which is a declarative specification
that combines natural language instructions
(via the docstring) and structured types (in code) that's formatted a specific way to describe what they
want from the LM. The signature uses an [adapter](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/adapters/) to format parts of the prompt. When starting to
work with DSPy, it's not necessary to think too much about adapters (just know that they exist).
The signature is the primary interface that you need to work with, and serves as the entry point into
a DSPy workflow.

## What's in a module?

The module is the core unit of a DSPy program that takes in a signature
(or a composition of signatures, as shown in [part 1](/blog/learning-dspy-1-the-power-of-good-abstractions)),
and encapsulates the program's logic and control flow. Modules are composable, allowing you to easily
bake in any arbitrary domain or business logic into the pipeline.

Just as signatures combine natural language instructions
with a structured type system, modules define the program's control flow (in code) via
conventional programming constructs, such as `if-else` statements, `for` loops and deterministic
function calls interweaved with LM calls as needed.

The example below initializes DSPy's built-in `Predict` module for the resume extraction and
inspects its contents by running the `.save()` method.

```py
# Define `ExtractResume` signature here
# ...
# Initialize module
extractor = dspy.Predict(ExtractResume)
# Save the module
extractor.save("my_extractor.json")
```

This writes the program's state to a JSON file, that looks like this:
```json
{
  "traces": [],
  "train": [],
  "demos": [],
  "signature": {
    "instructions": "Extract the resume from the text.",
    "fields": [
      {
        "prefix": "Text:",
        "description": "${text}"
      },
      {
        "prefix": "Resume:",
        "description": "${resume}"
      }
    ]
  },
  "lm": null,
  "metadata": {
    "dependency_versions": {
      "python": "3.13",
      "dspy": "3.0.2",
      "cloudpickle": "3.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Inspecting the program's contents this way reveals some interesting details about the "surface area"
for optimization that the module exposes. In its raw, unoptimized state, a module stores empty objects
for traces, training examples and demos. These are all placeholders for the optimizer, which will add those
in when the module is compiled (we'll explore what optimizers do in detail in the next post).

The signature's state is also fully persisted within the module's JSON representation.
This is because the module relies entirely on the signature to obtain the data it needs to prompt the LM,
and also to parse/coerce the LM outputs to the types specified by the signature. Each signature consists
of the following items:
- `instructions`: The user instruction as per the signature's docstring.
- `fields`: A list of input/output fields for the task, each with a `prefix` and `description`.
    - `prefix`: A string that prefixes the field in the prompt.
    - `description`: A string that describes the field's content.

<Aside title="Observation">
Currently, only the signature's instructions are modified during optimization (when using algorithms
like MIPROv2 or GEPA). However, judging by the fact that the signature's field prefixes and descriptions
are also included in the module's save state, it's quite likely that a future version of DSPy will
include a means to optimize more parts of the signature as well!

Exposing a larger part of the signature
to the optimizer could enable more fine-grained control over the prompting process, potentially leading
to even better performance.
</Aside>

Initially, the `instructions` field of a module is exactly what the user writes in the signature's docstring.
After optimization via algorithms like MIPROv2 or GEPA, these instructions are completely rewritten by
LMs, so the new, optimized module will persist those instructions instead.

Because a module's state can be persisted to JSON, it's trivial to version-control it and revert to
a previous state if needed. This is great from a reproducibility perspective, because an optimized
DSPy program can easily be shared with others, restored and evaluated.

## Robustness to paradigm shifts

Exposing signatures and modules as the primary interface to the user allows DSPy to be
incredibly robust to future paradigm changes as AI models evolve:
- If new interaction paradigms with LMs emerge (e.g., something more advanced than `ChainofThought`),
a new custom module can be created to incorporate the new logic, so just a single line of code may
change to change the behaviour of the entire system.
- If better formats become available that could improve
the way types are represented to the LM in the prompt, custom adapters (which are handled by the signature and
the underlying adapter) can easily [be created](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/8614). Again,
with only a single line of code changed, the new adapter can be seamlessly integrated into the existing pipeline.

Even in a more drastic scenario, if the entire paradigm of auto-regressive language models and transformers give
way to something else that's not transformer-based, because optimizers in DSPy don't rely on model weights being accessible,
new optimizers can be developed without changing the underlying logic of signatures and modules.

All these are incredible design features that explain why the fundamental abstractions of DSPy have largely
remained unchanged since its inception in 2022, despite so many rapid advancements in LMs and their
prompting strategies. It's arguable that DSPy's abstractions are _even more useful_ today than they were in
the past, because they offer a flexible, transparent and structured way to incorporate human intent into AI systems.

## Conclusions

The design philosophy of DSPy is centered around modular components that help build better AI systems. At first glance,
the abstractions offered may seem to be at a rather high-level, but when explored more deeply, they offer _just_ the right amount of
flexibility and user control to express almost any desired logic.

As Omar Khattab, creator of DSPy, said in this [fireside chat](https://youtu.be/ctyU0zfWgrA?si=rZJWCI2ZkvSCHLOE&t=1307):
DSPy is more than just a framework. It functions like a high-level language that helps you specify the
behaviour you want, by saying things in the language you actually speak, and combines it with some structure,
using code. Signatures, modules and optimizers work together to conveniently expose these
three fundamental ways of communicating human intent to language models:

- **Code**: Provides structure (via a type system)
- **English**: Provides intent (in natural language)
- **Examples**: Provides demonstrations to tune the long tail of edge cases where tweaking prompts or adding few-shot
demos can improve the outcome

> DSPy uses a **_combination_** of code, English and examples to elicit the required behaviour
> from the AI system, without any manual tuning of prompts. Once the baseline performance is known
> (because evaluation is baked into the process), an optimizer can seamlessly integrate with
> the given signatures and modules to improve the system.

The more you work with DSPy, the clearer it becomes that signatures are a better abstraction than freeform
text prompts, because of the way they combine structure (code) and intent (English). Modules are better abstractions
than functions or prebuilt LM components, because they are far more composable and adaptable --
they define the logic of the program (via code), and they can be automatically improved with optimizers (via examples).

Hopefully, this post, in combination with the previous one, highlights the DSPy philosophy well (and why it matters
if you're building compound AI systems). In the next post, we'll go deeper into optimizers, and walk through a
workflow that improves the performance of a given DSPy program. 🚀

[^1]: You don't _have_ to define Pydantic models upfront in DSPy. As shown in the [docs](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/signatures/)
you can directly start by defining string signatures as a first step. However, for any non-trivial structured output
task in DSPy, it's typical to use the "class-based approach", i.e., creating Pydantic models upfront
that allow more precise definitions of complex input and output types (with descriptions)
and passing those to the signature.

[^2]: It's very interesting how much the DSPy community's own understanding of what it is has evolved
between 2024-2025. Today, DSPy has become a widely loved framework by its
ever-growing user community, not just for optimizing prompts, but for helping users build reliable, modular
AI systems. While the abstractions DSPy uses may _seem_ very high-level at initial glance,
every component is transparent, and the overall design of the framework makes it very flexible and easy to
customize to almost any workflow.
