Throughout 2025, I've gotten plenty of positive feedback on my writing from very diverse audiences,
from engineers and scientists, to founders, CEOs, academics and even non-technical folks. I'm clearly doing
_something_ right (it can't all be just "vibes"). Over the last few days, as I've been reflecting on this,
I realize that there are a few things I've been doing at a subconscious level as I write each of
my posts.

In this post, I'll externalize this thought process into a framework that I hope is useful for folks
like me who are writing technical content.
Because so much writing is already being done by LLMs nowadays, I want to focus on what I believe humans
can do better (with or without the help of LLMs), and to encourage folks to write more authentically.

Lately, I've been lamenting over the degradation in
my X and LinkedIn feeds -- most posts are video-based slop that caters to the low-attention span crowd,
and many long-form written posts are often AI-generated (especially on LinkedIn), lacking depth
and substance. So, I hope this post resonates with folks who want to read/write more in 2026 (I know I do)!

<Aside title="How much of this post was LLM-generated?">
I only used LLMs at the _very end_ of the writing process, to help me proofread and paraphrase certain
sentences that felt a little clunky. The core ideas, outline and flow of the post were all
entirely human-generated. Writing this post took me ~3 hours, from ideation to first draft.
</Aside>

## It all begins with the way you read

I firmly believe that the way you read shapes
how you write. The example I give below applies mostly to text-based content online, like
blogs, essays and papers. When I come across any long-form piece of writing, I tend to subconsciously
break down the content into three layers.

<Figure src={Img1} alt="The three layers of written content (online)" />

Even though I love reading long-form content, time is often scarce, so I don't begin by
reading the post word-for-word. I _always_ do a first pass where I skim through the entire
piece at a very high-level, looking for key takeaways. This is driven by the "outline" layer of the post.
The outline gives me an immediate sense of the author's vision, and why I should care about reading the
entire post in detail. If the outline comes across in my mind as haphazard or incoherent, I usually
don't bother coming back.

Once the outline passes my initial filter, I normally come back (when convenient) to read the entire post.
In this pass, I tend to focus on the "ideas" that seem interesting, and read those sections more carefully.
The ideas are the meat of the post -- they lay down
the core themes, concepts and arguments the author is trying to convey. If the ideas are too generic
or shallow, I usually stop reading further and move on to other things.

Finally, if the ideas resonate with me at a deeper level, I carefully read the entire post word-for-word,
paying attention to the "details". The details include the specific details, anecdotes, data points and
references the author uses to elaborate on their ideas. If the post lacks sufficient detail, it can end up
feeling "empty" -- even though there are very well-written words, there's no substance behind them, and the
reader walks away with no new insights. This is very common in AI-generated content (what people are calling
"slop").

Another way I think about these three layers is in terms of their level of granularity, and how the mind
perceives them.

<Figure src={Img2} alt="The flow between layers when reading written content" />

Layer | Granularity | Focus | Purpose
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Outline** | coarse | structure, vision | Why should I care?
**Ideas** | medium | concepts, themes | What are the important ideas/themes?
**Text** | fine | examples, anecdotes, data | How does it work?

While reading, I tend to jump between these layers quite fluidly. Most times, I might skim the outline first,
then dive a little deeper to understand the key ideas, then jump back to the outline (all at a subconscious level)
which lets me gauge structure and coherence. This relates to the concept of _flow_ in writing.

Good flow isn't just about linearly presenting ideas from top to bottom -- it's also how smooth the transition
is from one idea to the next one. This allows readers to rapidly move between layers with ease as they're
reading, without feeling lost or confused. Flow is what ties in the three layers together, creating a sense
of coherence and unity, making the reader walk away feeling like they gained something in the process. 

## Why LLM-generated text is so dissatisfying

Shreya Shankar wrote two excellent posts[^1],[^2] about why LLM-generated text always seems
slightly "off", sometimes even "uninviting to read".
Ted Chiang's New Yorker piece[^3] from earlier this year that likens ChatGPT's outputs to
"blurry JPEGs of the web" also hits home.

LLMs don’t inherently care about the topic they’re writing about the way humans do. They take instructions
from the prompt and generate text in response. But getting from what humans mean to something the model can
act on, through prompting and the way it’s conditioned in the model's weights, is **inherently lossy**.
This means that the nuances and grounded world-knowledge that humans possess in droves,
are completely missed -- the LLM fails right at the beginning, at the "outline" layer.

Next, LLMs can very effectively regurgitate common ideas and themes from their "deep research" abilities. Because
they can very rapidly retrieve and scan through vast amounts of text, the ideas they generate often feel
like a mashup of existing concepts. This means they also fail at the "ideas" layer - when asked to generate
ideas to assist in writing, they often produce content where the result feels
way too generic, shallow and unoriginal.

It's only at the bottom layer ("text") where LLMs might actually fare better than most humans do (for now).
LLMs are pretty much perfect at writing grammatically correct text, and can even mimic different writing
styles very convincingly.
But even at this layer, there are issues -- AI-generated text is that it's overly verbose _throughout_.
An LLM tends to have poor judgment about when to be concise and when to elaborate. Human-written text,
on the other hand, tends to intelligently use repetition and verbosity where needed.

As Shreya Shankar puts it in [her post](https://www.sh-reya.com/blog/ai-writing/):

> It’s now cheap to generate medium-quality text—and even high-quality text, when the scope is narrow and
> well-defined. But figuring out what to say, how to frame it, and when and how to go deep is still the
> hard part. That’s what takes judgment, and that’s what LLMs can’t do for me (yet).

Because LLMs can't innately _feel_ what the writer wants to convey at a deep
level (it totally depends on the instructions in the prompt) -- the ideas end up feeling hollow, the outline
disjointed, and the text overly wordy, leading to that now-familiar dissatisfying feeling as you go through it.

## How can we write more authentically?

I'll now share how I apply the above framework to my own writing process, using this very post as an example.
It all begins with the ideas, followed by the outline, and finally the details.

<Figure src={Img3} alt="The ideas are the most important piece" />

<Steps>
1. **Ideas first**: Everything begins with what ideas I want to convey. For this post, the key ideas revolved
around "what do I look for when I read?", "what is lacking in most AI-generated content?", and
"how can humans write better?".

2. **Outline next**: Once I have the ideas clear in my mind, I create a rough outline of the post, writing down
the sub-headings and key points I want to cover under each section. The outline essentially _emerges_ from
the ideas, so this step rarely takes much effort. As I write, the outline may evolve, with sections being added,
removed or rearranged to improve flow.

3. **Details last**: Finally, I fill in the details for each section, elaborating on the ideas with useful examples,
diagrams, anecdotes and references. In this step, I may use LLMs to help me clean up the verbiage of specific
sections, but I invariably end up editing the LLM's work to ensure it doesn't break the flow.

</Steps>

Put simply, if I don't have clearly formed ideas that I think are worth sharing, I _don't write anything at all_.
I tend to keep an "idea graveyard" where I jot down interesting writing ideas as they come to me,
but not all of them survive the test of time. I have a ton of ideas in my graveyard that never ended up becoming
posts, because the transition from "idea" → "outline" → "details" never felt natural.

Offloading the ideation and outlining process (layers #1 and #2) to the LLM is where I think a lot of
LLM-generated content goes wrong.
I think it's okay to use LLMs for #3, to assist with paraphrasing or polishing the text, but for the
foreseeable future, and certainly in the coming year, I believe the core ideas and outline for content
must come from the human writer -- because only humans have genuine attachment to the
idea at hand, allowing them to exercise judgment about what to include, what to leave out, and how
to lay out the broader vision in a way that's coherent and interesting.

<Aside type="tip" title="What about titles?">
The title is normally the _last_ thing I write, after the entire post is done. I find that writing the
title in the beginning boxes me into a particular framing, stifling my creativity and leading to "writer's block".
Once the post is done, I reflect on the key ideas once more, and come up with a title that best captures
the essence of the post. LLMs can help a lot with coming up with good titles, but I avoid going overboard
with clickbait or ragebait titles!
</Aside>

## Conclusions

There's something innately beautiful about authentic human writing that causes it to resonate at
a deeper level. Good writing expresses the writer's personality and thought process, and even though
I may not have met them, I can often feel a connection to the writer nonetheless.
I'd really love for more of us to write this way -- from the heart, with
genuine ideas, a well-thought-out outline, and rich details that bring those ideas to life.

Using a rough framework like I showed above for reading and writing has worked well for me over the years.
This post took ~3 hours to write, all the way from initial ideation to the completion of the first draft.
While it's definitely slower to write this way than just prompting an LLM "write a blog post about X",
I firmly believe that the end result is way more satisfying for _both_ the writer and the reader.

If you've made it this far, I'm sure you'll agree with me on most points! Thanks for reading, and
here's hoping for less AI slop, and more authentic, long-form content for and by humans, in 2026! 🚀
